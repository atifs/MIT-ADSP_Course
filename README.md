# Applied Data Science Program - Leveraging AI for Effective Decision Making by MIT Professional Education

This is a repository of my work during <b>Advanced Data Science Program - Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making</b> course by <b>MIT-PE</b>, as part of March 2024 cohort. It may include course material that was refered and any supplementary learning material.

The link to the course is https://professional-education-gl.mit.edu/mit-applied-data-science-course

Following were the main skills, to name few, acquired during the course:
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Neural Networks
- Artificial Intelligence
- Recommendation Systems



Following is the breakdown of the course modules where each module had a project (6 hands-on course projects, 1 Elective project, and 1 final Capstone project --> ~8 Projects in total):

<b> Pre-work:</b>
- Module: Introduction to Python (Python learning by mentors -- Python practical exercises and quizzes)
- Introduction to Data Science and AI (Video on-demand, chapter slides, and timed quizzes)


Online Classes by <b>MIT Professors</b> (Mentored Classes over the weekends by different mentors --> class revisions and project guidance etc. for each module):

<b> Module 1: Foundations - Python and Statistics (1 hands-on Project)</b>
- Python Foundations - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Arrays and Matrix handling, Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistics Foundations: Basic/Descriptive Statistics, Distributions (Binomial, Poisson, etc.), Bayes, Inferential Statistics

<b> Module 2: Data Analysis and Visualization (1 hands-on Project)</b>
- Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization (PCA and t-SNE) for visualization and batch correction
- Introduction to Unsupervised Learning: Clustering includes- Hierarchical, K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture
- Networks: Examples (data as network versus network to represent dependence among variables), determine important nodes and edges in a network, clustering in a network
  
<b> Module 3: Machine Learning (1 hands-on Project)</b>
- Introduction to Supervised Learning - Regression
